# Windranger/FranBunnyFFXII

Windranger is a trans woman notorious in the Piracy community for being insufferable and inconsolable, unable to take geniune advice for her many life issues, as it usually comes from lonely nerds who have no life experiences of their own.

She has migrated community to community for the past decade or so, wreaking havoc onto netizens by trauma dumping in countless forums, making fun of people incapable of losing their virginity, and forever scarring people unfortunate enough to catch wind of her sexual escapades.

She currently runs the subreddit r/animepussy, which more or less gives you an idea of who she is.

As a well-known member of Snackbox, Windranger has made it clear that she is utterly obsessed with Elfen Lied.

She is known to watch Dubbed anime, watching both dub and sub of the same anime. Rewatches the same anime over and over again, constantly bitches about "Modern anime" and is stuck in the past.
